This art, which started as a hobby by their first grandfather Hüseyin Usta in 1890, has progressed over time and handmade knives have become one of the handicrafts that make a great contribution to the promotion of Sinop today. High carbon Swedish tool steel is used in the making of the knives, and buffalo, deer neck and rosewood roots are used in the manufacture of the handles. The balustrade and top material are made of quality brass, and the scabbards are made of quality cowhide. Knives are produced as decorative knives, kitchen knives and hunting knives.",

There are many people who are interested in this art in the city center. Kotras, which were initially offered as souvenirs to the visitors on the passenger ferries arriving at Sinop Port, became famous over time and began to be sent out of the city as souvenirs. Boats bought as gifts by domestic and foreign tourists coming to Sinop today have become the symbol of Sinop.",
