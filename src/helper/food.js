Some flour and starch are mixed together and the dough is rolled out with this mixture. Both sides of the rolled phyllo are cooked on the sheet until lightly browned and water is poured into a separate tray. Another tray is greased. The phyllo dough is dipped in a tray filled with water and taken out, and laid on the greased tray on top of each other. Only the space between each phyllo should be lubricated with oil and sprinkled with cracked walnuts. After the process is finished, it is oiled and cut in the form of a pastry and given to the oven. Meanwhile, sweet syrup is prepared. Sherbet is poured over the dessert that comes out of the oven. The only thing to note here is that one is hot and one is cold.",
